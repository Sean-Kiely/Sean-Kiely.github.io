    <h2>What It Is</h2>
      <p>I have created the world's first fully functioning sonic tractor beam, capable of suspending, moving and manipulating small objects using only the power of sound waves.</p>
      <p>I used an array of 64 miniature loudspeakers to surround the polystyrene ball with high-pitched, high-intensity sound waves, creating an acoustic “force field” capable of lifting it into mid- air. By carefully controlling the output of the speakers, the ball can then be held in place, moved or rotated.</p>
